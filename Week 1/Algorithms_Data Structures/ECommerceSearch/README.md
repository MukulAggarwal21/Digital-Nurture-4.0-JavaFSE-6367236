## Algorithm Analysis

### Linear Search - O(n)
```
Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1) - Element found at first position
- Average Case: O(n/2) ≈ O(n) - Element found in middle
- Worst Case: O(n) - Element not found or at last position

Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses constant extra space
```

### Binary Search - O(log n)
```
Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1) - Element found at middle position
- Average Case: O(log n) - Element found after log n divisions
- Worst Case: O(log n) - Element at extremes or not found

Space Complexity: O(1) iterative, O(log n) recursive
Prerequisite: Array must be sorted
```

### Performance Comparison
